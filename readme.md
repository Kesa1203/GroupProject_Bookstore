BookStore Database Project
Project Overview
The BookStore Database is a relational database designed to efficiently manage and store operational data for a bookstore. This database enables the storage, retrieval, and analysis of essential information, such as books, authors, customers, orders, and shipping details. It is an end-to-end solution for managing complex data while ensuring robust security, scalability, and usability.

Key Features
Comprehensive schema design to support bookstore operations.

Many-to-many relationships between books and authors.

Customer and address management with support for multiple address statuses.

Order and shipping tracking with detailed history.

Role-based access control for enhanced security.

Technologies Used
MySQL: For database design, querying, and management.

Draw.io: For visualizing database schema and relationships (optional).

Prerequisites
Before starting this project, you should have:

A basic understanding of relational database concepts.

Experience with SQL commands for creating and managing tables.

Familiarity with user roles and permissions in MySQL.

Project Structure
Tables Included:
book: Stores details about the books in the store.

book_author: Manages the many-to-many relationship between books and authors.

author: Stores information about authors.

book_language: Lists possible languages for books.

publisher: Contains information about book publishers.

customer: Stores customer data.

customer_address: Links customers to their addresses.

address_status: Tracks the status of each address.

address: Stores address information for customers and orders.

country: Lists countries where addresses are located.

cust_order: Stores order information placed by customers.

order_line: Links orders to the books they include.

shipping_method: Lists shipping methods available for orders.

order_history: Tracks order status changes over time.

order_status: Lists possible statuses for an order.

Installation and Setup
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Download or clone the repository containing the SQL scripts:

bash
git clone https://github.com/Kesa1203/GroupProject_Bookstore.git
cd BookStoreDatabase
Step 2: Set Up the Database
Create the Database: Run the provided script to create the database:

sql
CREATE DATABASE BookStore;
USE BookStore;
Create Tables: Use the script create_tables.sql to create tables in the correct order:

sql
-- Provided SQL script to create all tables
Insert Sample Data: Populate the database with sample data using populate_tables.sql:

sql
-- Provided SQL script for inserting sample data
Step 3: Manage User Permissions
Run the following script to configure database users:

Admin User: Full privileges on the database.

Regular User: Read-only access.

sql
CREATE USER 'admin_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'strongpassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON BookStore.* TO 'admin_user'@'%';

CREATE USER 'regular_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'userpassword';
GRANT SELECT ON BookStore.* TO 'regular_user'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Database Schema
The schema is designed to reflect real-world bookstore operations with normalized tables and foreign key relationships. The following diagram (created in Draw.io or another tool) visualizes the relationships between tables: https://app.diagrams.net/#HKesa1203%2FGroupProject_Bookstore%2Fmain%2FBookstore.drawio#%7B%22pageId%22%3A%22vVcK6Z69ptN_cMEZQ-FN%22%7D

Testing and Queries
Example Queries:
Retrieve all books and authors:
sql
SELECT b.title AS book_title, a.name AS author_name
FROM book AS b
JOIN book_author AS ba ON b.book_id = ba.book_id
JOIN author AS a ON ba.author_id = a.author_id;
Total revenue from all orders:
sql
SELECT SUM(b.price * ol.quantity) AS total_revenue
FROM order_line AS ol
JOIN book AS b ON ol.book_id = b.book_id;
Additional queries are provided in the test_queries.sql script for detailed analysis and testing.

Expected Outcomes
By completing this project, we will gain:

Practical experience in designing and implementing a relational database.

Strong SQL skills for creating, managing, and querying data.

Insights into database security and user access management.
